# ig-notifier

This script checks an instagram users bio and sends a text if the data has changed based on a specfic need. 

This is a personal project I created out of a desire to get an update when a specific instagram user changed their bio to reflect them accepting new customers. Now I no longer need to check the app and will get a text when the individual changes that info. 

I am hosting this script on pythonanywhere.com

This is my first python project
